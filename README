John Stuart and Jose Rodriguez's Assignment 2

--------------------------
I Introduction
--------------------------
This program is a basic shell that functions as a terminal. It will take in the commands that the user desires and executes them if they are legal syntax.

--------------------------
II Format of Commands
--------------------------
 The commands are accepted in the following format:
A command that is followed by a connector(in this program connectors are ";", "&&", and "||"). There are no limits as to how many commands you want to execute. You just have to make sure that there is a connector between any two commands.

	Example of a single command: ls -a
	
	Example of multiple commands: ls -a; echo hello || git status; echo Soviet Russia

--------------------------
III Other Functionality
--------------------------
- This shell contains an exit command. When "exit" is typed into the command prompt, the terminal will close.

- If "#" is input at any time within the command line, anything after "#" inlcuding itself will be read as a comment and be ignored.

	Example of comment: echo Taco Bell; # ls; echo disneyland is overrated
	This command line will only perform the task "echo Taco Bell".

-------------------------
IV Known bugs/Limitations
-------------------------
- The program does not work if the user does not input the correct characters for the connectors.

- A single command with a connector is not accepted.
	
	Example: echo chipotle is not authentic;
